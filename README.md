## Hi there, it's Marvin 👋



Hey there! I'm anengineer who loves solving problems. When I'm not staring at my terminal, you can find me on the slopes snowboarding or on the mats practicing jiu-jitsu. I'm always on the lookout for developing efficiency. 

### Currently Working On 

I'm currently enhancing my developer workflow with Neovim, building custom configurations to streamline my coding process. Additionally, I'm working on:

- Building a home server and homelab environment 🖥️
- Learning Kubernetes and setting up my own homelab for a simulated HA setup
- You can read more about my journey and technical insights on my blog: [https://marvintv.github.io/posts/](https://marvintv.github.io/posts/) ✍️
- Creating data engineering and ML pipelines to experiment with large datasets and real-time analytics
