## Hi there, it's Marvin 👋



When I'm not staring at my terminal, you can find me on the slopes snowboarding or on the mats practicing jiu-jitsu. I'm always on the lookout for developing connections.

### currently?
- building out my homelab on a NUC mini pc
- creating a highly available [K8s cluster](https://github.com/marvintv/k8s-lab) on my homelab, where I'm hosting a bunch of fun applications to learn and build from.
- researching AI agents and MCP servers.
    * currently trying to find a way to scale MCP servers and create an autonomous MCP ecosystem

## my philosphy
- be a good person 🤝
- having fun, and trusting the process of life long learning.
- make and do great things 💠
