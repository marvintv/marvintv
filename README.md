## Hi there, it's Marvin 👋



Hey there! I'm a passionate engineer who loves solving problems. When I'm not staring at my terminal, you can find me on the slopes snowboarding or on the mats practicing jiu-jitsu. I believe the discipline and creativity from these hobbies directly translate to how I approach software development - always looking for that balance between technical expertise and practical solutions.

### Currently Working On 

I'm currently enhancing my developer workflow with Neovim, building custom configurations to streamline my coding process. Additionally, I'm working on:

- Building a home server and homelab environment 🖥️
- Learning Kubernetes and setting up my own homelab for a simulated HA setup
- You can read more about my journey and technical insights on my blog: [https://marvintv.github.io/posts/](https://marvintv.github.io/posts/) ✍️
- Creating data engineering and ML pipelines to experiment with large datasets and real-time analytics

*""Be water, my friend. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend." - Bruce Lee 🌊"* ❄️
